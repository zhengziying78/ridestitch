# RideStitch

`RideStitch` is an iOS app for cyclists, bikepackers, and tourers to merge multiple ride recordings into one seamless ride — and upload the result back to RideWithGPS.

Whether you're stitching together a multi-day tour or fixing a split ride caused by a GPS dropout or app crash, `RideStitch` makes it fast and easy.

## 🚴 Why RideStitch?

There’s no easy way to combine rides across platforms:

- **RideWithGPS** doesn’t support merging rides natively.
- **Strava** doesn’t allow combining activities post-upload.
- **Garmin Connect** can export rides, but has no merge tool.
- Manual GPX editing is tedious and error-prone.

`RideStitch` solves that by providing a dedicated, mobile-friendly tool to:
- Merge rides
- Normalize time gaps (optional)
- Export a clean, unified file
- Upload directly back to your RideWithGPS account

## 🔧 Planned Features

- Import rides RideWithGPS
- Combine a multi-day tour into one ride
- Fix a ride accidentally split mid-recording
- Create a clean, shareable ride file for analysis or replay
- Normalize timestamps (optional)
- Fill short gaps between rides
- Upload the merged ride directly back to RideWithGPS
