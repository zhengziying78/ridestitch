# RideStitch

`RideStitch` is an iOS app for cyclists, bikepackers, and tourers to merge multiple ride recordings into one seamless ride â€” and upload the result back to RideWithGPS.

Whether you're stitching together a multi-day tour or fixing a split ride caused by a GPS dropout or app crash, `RideStitch` makes it fast and easy.

## ðŸš´ Why RideStitch?

Thereâ€™s no easy way to combine rides across platforms:

- **RideWithGPS** doesnâ€™t support merging rides natively.
- **Strava** doesnâ€™t allow combining activities post-upload.
- **Garmin Connect** can export rides, but has no merge tool.
- Tools like [fitfiletools](https://www.fitfiletools.com/) and [merge-activities](https://gtt.feub.net/merge-activities/) work great, but:
  - They're not mobile-friendly
  - They require handling GPX/TCX/FIT files

`RideStitch` is built mobile-first and platform-integrated â€” so you can stitch and re-upload rides from your phone with no file wrangling.

## ðŸ”§ Planned Features

- Import rides RideWithGPS
- Combine a multi-day tour into one ride
- Fix a ride accidentally split mid-recording
- Create a clean, shareable ride file for analysis or replay
- Normalize timestamps (optional)
- Fill short gaps between rides
- Upload the merged ride directly back to RideWithGPS
